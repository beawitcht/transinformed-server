I am currently self-medicating with hormones, whilst this carries a number of risks I've determined that these risks are outweighed by the risks to my mental wellbeing as a result of not being able to affirm my gender through the use of HRT. 
 One of the reasons I'm seeking help from you is to have access to HRT and health monitoring whilst minimising risk.
