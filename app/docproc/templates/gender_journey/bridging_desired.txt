I am seeking a bridging prescription as a harm reduction strategy, this is recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists who state “…the GP or other medical practitioner involved in the patient’s care may prescribe ‘bridging’ endocrine treatments as part of a holding and harm reduction strategy” (Good practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with gender dysphoria, 2013) 

The GMC also provide guidance who state “Our advice should reassure doctors who wish to prescribe for their trans patients that it wouldn’t be against GMC guidance to do so” (Trans healthcare - Mental health and bridging prescriptions, 2022) 

The NHS service specification also states "Endocrine and other pharmacological interventions may be recommended by a registered medical practitioner in the specialist multi-disciplinary team where they are essential for the purpose of harm reduction, and where they are in the individual’s best interest for reducing gender dysphoria" (Service specification: Gender Identity Services for Adults (Non-Surgical Interventions), 2019)
